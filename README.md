# Churn Prediction for Telecommunications Company
**Language** - Python<br>
**Project** - 3<sup>rd</sup> Year Data Science (SLIIT)<br>
**Overview** -
The goal of this project is to predict customer churn for a telecom company. It was developed to identify the customers who are most likely to cancel their subscriptions using a _powerful machine learning model_. The project was developed from past client datasets gathered from _Kaggle_, including demographics, usage trends, contracts, and payment history. Exploratory Data Analysis is used after preprocessing, which includes handling missing data and outliers, to find patterns that separate churned customers from non-churned ones. The application uses machine learning methods including logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests. Real-time predictions are made possible by this model's integration into a user-friendly web application utilizing _Flask_. Finally, The application is hosted on _Heroku_ for easy accessibility.
