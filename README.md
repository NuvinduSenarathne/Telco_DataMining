# Churn Prediction for Telecommunications Company
## Project - 3<sup>rd</sup> Year Data Science (SLIIT)
### Overview :
The goal of this project is to predict customer churn for a telecom company. It was developed to identify the customers who are most likely to cancel their subscriptions using a **powerful machine learning model**. The project was developed from past client datasets gathered from **Kaggle**, including demographics, usage trends, contracts, and payment history. Exploratory Data Analysis is used after preprocessing, which includes handling missing data and outliers, to find patterns that separate churned customers from non-churned ones. The application uses machine learning methods including logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests. Real-time predictions are made possible by this model's integration into a user-friendly web application utilizing **Flask**. Finally, The application is hosted on **Heroku** for easy accessibility.

The data set contains 7034 records including 33 columns and 17 of which are used as the input
variables. The columns named as ‘CustomerID’ which is corresponds to Customer’s ID is
excluded from our prediction model and ‘churn’ which has a value of ‘yes’ and ‘no’ is used as
the target(output) variable
